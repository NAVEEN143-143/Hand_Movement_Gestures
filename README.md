# Hand_Movement_Gestures
The Hand Gesture Recognition System is a computer vision project that utilizes OpenCV, NumPy, and PyAutoGUI to interpret hand gestures captured through a webcam and translate them into specific keyboard actions. The system initializes by setting up a camera feed and creating a GUI for color adjustments to fine-tune hand detection. It captures video frames, converts them to HSV color space, and applies color thresholds to isolate the hand region. Contours of the hand are detected, and convexity defects are analyzed to count the number of extended fingers. Depending on the number of detected fingers, different actions are triggered, such as play/pause (spacebar), volume up/down, and media forward navigation. The system provides real-time feedback by displaying the processed frames and detected gestures, making it an interactive tool for hands-free media control.
